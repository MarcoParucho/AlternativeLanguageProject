Which programming language and version did you pick?

I picked JavaScript, this version provided by VSCODE requires typescript 2.3.

Why did you pick this programming language?

In previous courses I had the opportunity to write a litte of JavaScript, also, in May 20th I am starting an internship that requires JavaScript.

How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 

I used for loops to iterate through the csv file, I ran into some issues so I had to use if statements to deal with reading the file. Also, the obvious ones that are require to complete the assignment like detecting a null cell. Also a used a 'cell' class to define each cell. This was helpful when dealing with the data. I did not try to use a hashmap because I am not to confortable with that structure. 

List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.

Answer the following questions (and provide a corresponding screen showing output answering them):
What company (oem) has the highest average weight of the phone body?

Was there any phones that were announced in one year and released in another? What are they? Give me the oem and models.

How many phones have only one feature sensor?

What year had the most phones launched in any year later than 1999?
